introduction
What’s good for your heart is great for your taste buds!  The recipes in this 
cookbook show that you don’t have to lose flavor to eat nutritious foods.   
Keep the Beat™ Recipes:  Deliciously Healthy Dinners contains 75 heart healthy 
recipes.  More than two-thirds of these recipes were created for the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) by a Culinary Institute of America- 
trained chef and a James Beard Foundation award-winning registered dietitian.  
The remaining recipes come from popular NHLBI cookbooks—Keep the Beat™ 
Heart Healthy Recipes from the NHLBI, Heart Healthy Home Cooking African 
American Style, and Delicious Heart Healthy Latino Recipes.
Keep the Beat™ Recipes:  Deliciously Healthy Dinners is part of a planned series 
of new “Keep the Beat™” cookbooks from the NHLBI.   
eating for health
Staying healthy can be a challenge, but lifestyle changes like eating healthfully 
and being physically active can help lower your risk for heart disease and other 
conditions.  
One way to eat a healthy diet is to choose a variety of foods.  Variety matters 
because no food has all the nutrients that your heart and the rest of your body 
need.  A healthy eating plan is one that:
•	 Emphasizes	fruits,	vegetables,	whole	grains,	and	fat-free	or	low-fat	milk	 
and milk products
•	 Includes	lean	meats,	poultry,	fish,	beans,	eggs,	and	nuts
•	 Is	low	in	saturated	fat,	trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars
Also, think about what you drink—choose nonalcoholic, low/no-calorie options 
such as water, skim milk, iced tea, club soda, diet soda, and sparkling beverages 
as a substitute for regular, sweetened beverages.
When	it	comes	to	eating	healthfully,	portion	size	also	matters.		The	recipes	in	this	
cookbook are designed to give you a satisfying portion, while helping you stay 
within your calorie limits.
ixdeliciously healthy dinners
cooking a multicultural feast
Whether you’re an experienced cook or you shy away from the kitchen, Keep the 
Beat™ Recipes:  Deliciously Healthy Dinners can help you prepare dishes that have 
an American, Latino, Mediterranean, or Asian flair.  
Aside from being healthy, the recipes also are reasonably quick and easy to 
prepare.  Most of the main-dish meals take no more than 40 minutes to prepare 
and cook.  Side dishes cook in 30 minutes or less.  Some of the ingredients may 
be new to you, such as fish sauce and rice vinegar (which are used in many Asian 
dishes) and low-sodium products.  You can find these and other ingredients in 
most grocery stores.  Try looking in the spice, ethnic, or health food section of 
your local store.  If you can't find products labeled "low-sodium," compare the 
Nutrition Facts panels on available products to find the one with the lowest 
amount of sodium.  We also have suggested a select number of ingredient 
substitutions in the appendix on page 136.  For dishes that include fresh fruits, 
vegetables, and herbs, consider buying produce at your local farmer’s market.
The recipes in this cookbook also are limited in fat, saturated fat, trans fat, choles-
terol, sodium, and calories.  They use lean cuts of meat, poultry without the skin, 
fish, beans, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, small amounts of vegetable oil, and 
lots of herbs and spices for flavor.  Most of all, these recipes are delicious.  Try 
them on a weeknight, weekend, or special occasion. 
For more information on how to shop for, prepare, and serve healthy meals, see 
the appendixes for tools such as: 
•	 A	list	of	heart	healthy	items	to	keep	stocked	in	your	kitchen	
•	 A	glossary	of	common	cooking	terms
•	 A	“how	to”	guide	for	commonly	asked	cooking	questions	
•	 Temperature	rules	for	cooking	food	safely	
We hope you will enjoy the recipes in this cookbook.

4 To finish the soup, bring the broth back to a boil.  
Add the thawed vegetable stir-fry mix and mushroom 
caps, and simmer for 1 minute.  
5 Add the noodles and continue to simmer for another 
minute.
6 Add the beef and continue to simmer for about 
5 minutes or until the beef is slightly pink  
to brown (to a minimum internal temperature of  
145 °F).
7 Add tofu and scallions, and simmer 1–2 minutes until 
heated through.
8 Serve immediately in 1-cup portions.
Hint: There are several varieties of tofu, each with a different moisture level.  Silken and soft tofu are the 
moistest and easily blended into shakes, dips, and dressings.  Regular tofu is less moist, and it’s best for 
scrambling or using like cheese in casseroles.  Firm, extra-firm, and pressed tofus are the driest.  They 
absorb other flavors easily and hold their shape in stir-fries and on the grill.

1 C  fat-free evaporated milk
1 C  breadcrumbs
¼ C  rolled oats, crushed; pulse a  
few times in the food processor 
or crush between fingers to  
make smaller pieces 
1 C  whole-wheat flour
2 Tbsp  olive oil or vegetable oil

2 Tbsp  lemon juice
½ Tbsp  olive oil
4 C  red leaf lettuce, rinsed and  
dried
1 C  cherry tomatoes, rinsed and

medium-high heat on one side until golden brown, 
about 2–3 minutes.  Turn carefully, and pan fry the 
second side for an additional 2–3 minutes or until golden 
brown.  Remove from the pan, and place on paper 
towels to soak up excess oil.  Place on baking sheet, and 
finish cooking in a 350 °F oven for about 5–8 minutes 
(to a minimum internal temperature of 165 ºF).
6 For the salad, combine lemon juice and olive oil, and

1 Tbsp  butter
1 Preheat oven to 350 ºF.
2 Combine buttermilk and Dijon mustard.  Mix well.
3 Add turkey fillets to buttermilk mixture to marinate for 
5–10 minutes while preparing cornbread.
4 Grind cornbread in a food processor, or use your 
fingers to make coarse crumbs.  Place breadcrumbs on 
a baking sheet, and dry in a 300 °F oven or toaster 
oven for 4–5 minutes.  Do not brown.
5 Pour breadcrumbs into a dry, shallow dish.  Put egg 
white in a separate bowl.
6 Remove turkey from the buttermilk, and dip each fillet 
first in the egg white and then in the cornbread 
crumbs to coat.  Be sure to discard leftover buttermilk 
mixture and cornbread crumbs.
7 Place breaded turkey fillets on a baking sheet, and 
bake for 10–15 minutes (to a minimum internal 
temperature of 165 °F). 
8 While the turkey is cooking, combine chicken broth, 
cornstarch, carrots, sage, and butter in a medium 
saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring 
occasionally.  Lower temperature to a simmer.

Prep time:  10 minutes
Cook time:  10 minutes
for a delicious and quick meal, this pasta and scallops dish will hit the spot  
1  large lemon, grated for zest  
(and freshly squeezed for  
2 Tbsp lemon juice)
1 Tbsp  garlic, minced or pressed  
(about 2–3 cloves)
2 Tbsp  olive oil, divided into two  
1-Tbsp portions
16  large sea scallops (about 1 lb)
¼ tsp  salt

lemon and garlic pasta with pan-seared scallops (continued)
3 Heat a large nonstick pan or grill pan on high 
temperature until very hot.  Sprinkle the scallops with 
salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Toss to 
coat well.
4 Place the scallops in the hot pan.  Cook about 
4 minutes on each side, or until scallops are well 
browned and firm and milky white to the center  
(to a minimum internal temperature of 145 °F). 
5 After turning the scallops to the second side, drop 
the pasta into the boiling water.  Set temperature on 
medium, and cook for 2 minutes or the shortest 
recommended time according to package directions. 
6 When the pasta is done, set aside ½ cup of the 
cooking water.  Drain the pasta.  Return drained 
pasta to the pot, and toss with the warm olive oil 
mixture and the ½ cup reserved pasta water. 
7 Divide the pasta equally among four plates (about 
1 cup per plate).  Top each with four scallops.
8 Garnish each dish with ½ tablespoon of shredded 
parmesan cheese.  Serve immediately.  
Tip:  Delicious with a side of Baby Spinach With Golden Raisins and Pine Nuts (on page 107).

Prep time:  15 minutes
Cook time:    0 minutes
dine outside on a warm summer evening with this cool and satisfying salad  
1 can  (15½ oz) low-sodium chickpeas  
(or garbanzo beans), drained  
and rinsed
2 C  cherry tomatoes, rinsed and  
halved
1 Tbsp  olive oil
1 tsp  balsamic vinegar
2 Tbsp  fresh oregano, minced (or 1 tsp  
dried)
1/8 tsp  ground black pepper 
½ tsp  salt-free seasoning blend 
4  whole inner leaves of romaine  
lettuce, rinsed and dried
1 In a large salad bowl, combine beans and tomatoes.
2 In a small bowl, combine olive oil, vinegar, oregano, 
pepper, and salt-free seasoning blend.  Using a wire 
whisk, beat the ingredients until they blend into one 
thick sauce at the point where the oil and vinegar no 
longer separate. 
3 Pour the dressing over the beans and tomatoes, and 
mix gently to coat. 
4 Line four salad bowls with one romaine lettuce 
leaf each. 
5 Top each leaf with one-fourth of the bean mixture, 
and serve.  
Tip:  Serve with a fresh green salad and crusty bread to soak up the delicious dressing.
Note: If you can't find beans labeled "low-sodium," compare the Nutrition Facts panels to find the beans with 
the lowest amount of sodium.  Rinsing can help further reduce the sodium level.

lentils with brown rice and kale Prep time:    5 minutes
Cook time:  35 minutes
for a different flavor and even more fiber and protein, try quinoa in place of the brown rice; 
quinoa (pronounced KEEN-wah) is a grain native to South America
For lentils and kale:
1 C  brown lentils, rinsed
¼ tsp  salt
1/8 tsp  ground black pepper
4 C  kale, with heavy stems  
removed, rinsed and dried
For brown rice: 
1 C  instant brown rice, uncooked  
(for quinoa, follow cooking  
instructions on box)
¼ tsp  salt
½ tsp  dried basil
For onion:
2 Tbsp  olive oil
2 C  onion, diced
¼ tsp  salt
1/8 tsp  ground black pepper
1 Rinse lentils thoroughly in a fine wire colander, and 
remove any stones or debris. 
2 In a 4-quart saucepan, cover lentils with 2½ cups 
of water.  Add salt and pepper.  Cover, and bring  
to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat.  Simmer for  
15 minutes (until adding kale in step 5).
3 In another saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a 
boil.  Add rice, salt, and basil.  Cover, and cook for 
10 minutes.  Set aside.  
4 In a medium sauté pan, warm olive oil over medium 
heat and add onion, salt, and pepper.  Cook and stir 
until the onion pieces become soft and dark brown 
(caramelized),	but	not	burnt.		If	the	onions	start	to	
stick to the pan, add a few drops of water and scrape 
the onions loose.  Keep cooking until onions are 
completely	caramelized	(about	10–15	minutes	total).		
Remove from pan and set aside.
5 After the lentils have cooked for 15 minutes, lightly 
place the kale on top of the lentils.  Do not stir.  
Cover.  The kale will steam while the lentils continue 
to cook, for another 15 minutes.

broccoli with asian tofu Prep time:  20 minutes
Cook time:  20 minutes
the wonder of tofu is that it takes on the flavor of your favorite marinade 
1 pkg  (16 oz) firm tofu, drained
2 Tbsp  lite soy sauce
1 tsp  sesame oil (optional)
½ Tbsp  brown sugar
1 Tbsp  fresh ginger root, finely  
chopped or shredded  
(or 1 tsp ground)
1 lb  fresh broccoli, rinsed and cut  
into individual spears
1 Tbsp  peanut oil or vegetable oil
¼ tsp  crushed red pepper 
4 Tbsp  garlic, peeled and thinly sliced  
(about 8 cloves)
1 Tbsp  sesame seeds (optional)
Cooking spray
1 Slice tofu into eight pieces.  Place on a plate or flat 
surface covered with three paper towels.  Top with 
four more paper towels.  Top with another flat plate 
or cutting board.  Press down evenly and gently to 
squeeze	out	moisture.		Throw	away	paper	towels.		
Replace with fresh paper towels and press again.  
(The more liquid you remove, the more sauce the 
tofu will absorb.)
2 Place tofu in a bowl just big enough to hold all eight 
pieces lying on their widest side without overlapping.
3 In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, 
brown sugar, and ginger into a marinade, and stir 
thoroughly.  Pour over tofu.  Carefully turn the tofu 
several times to coat well.  Set aside.

4 Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick sauté pan coated 
with cooking spray.  Add broccoli and sauté for 
about 5 minutes, until it turns bright green and 
becomes tender and crispy.  Remove broccoli from 
pan and set aside.
5 Heat a grill pan or flat sauté pan over high heat.  
Drain tofu, reserving marinade.  Place on grill pan to 
heat for about 3 minutes.  Gently turn.  Heat the 
second side for 3 minutes. 
6 At the same time, in the sauté pan over medium-low 
heat, warm the peanut oil, crushed red pepper, and 
garlic until the garlic softens and begins to turn 
brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add broccoli 
and reserved marinade, and gently mix until well-
coated. 
7 Place two slices of tofu on each plate with 
one-quarter of the broccoli and marinade mixture.  
Sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional).

asparagus with 
      lemon sauce
Prep time:    5 minutes
Cook time:  10 minutes
lemon sauce makes fresh asparagus the perfect side dish for fish, scallops, chicken, or meat dishes 
20  medium asparagus spears,  
rinsed and trimmed
1  fresh lemon, rinsed (for peel  
and juice)
2 Tbsp  reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 Tbsp  dried parsley
1/8 tsp  ground black pepper 
1/16 tsp  salt
1 Place 1 inch of water in a 4-quart pot with a lid.  
Place a steamer basket inside the pot, and add 
asparagus.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  
Reduce heat to medium.  Cook for 5–10 minutes, 
until asparagus is easily pierced with a sharp knife.  
Do not overcook.  
2	 While	the	asparagus	cooks,	grate	the	lemon	zest	into	
a	small	bowl.		Cut	the	lemon	in	half	and	squeeze	the	
juice into the bowl.  Use the back of a spoon to press 
out extra juice and remove pits.  Add mayonnaise, 
parsley, pepper, and salt.  Stir well.  Set aside. 
3 When the asparagus is tender, remove the pot from 
the heat.  Place asparagus spears in a serving bowl.  
Drizzle	the	lemon	sauce	evenly	over	the	asparagus	
(about 1½ teaspoons per portion) and serve.

creamy squash soup with  
      shredded apples
Prep time:  10 minutes
Cook time:  20 minutes
this quick-to-fix soup is bursting with warm-you-up-flavor—serve with a crisp green salad and 
crusty whole-wheat bread 
2 boxes  (16 oz each) of frozen pureed  
winter (butternut) squash
2  medium apples (try Golden  
Delicious or Gala)
1 Tbsp  olive oil
½ tsp  pumpkin pie spice
2 cans  (12 oz each) fat-free  
evaporated milk
¼ tsp  salt
1/8 tsp  ground black pepper
1	 Place	the	frozen	squash	in	a	microwave-safe	dish.		
Cover loosely.  Defrost in the microwave on medium 
power for 5–10 minutes, until mostly thawed.
2 Meanwhile, peel then shred the apples using a grater 
or food processor, or peel and finely chop apples into 
thin strips.  Set aside ¼ cup. 
3 Warm oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat.  
Add all but ¼ cup of the apples.  Cook and stir until 
apples soften, about 5 minutes.

stirring after each addition. 
6 Season with salt and pepper.

8 Ladle into individual soup bowls.  Top each with a 
tablespoon of the unused apples.  Sprinkle with 
additional pumpkin pie spice if desired, and serve. 
Tip:	 For	chunkier	soup,	try	two	bags	(14	oz	each)	frozen	diced	butternut	squash.		Or,	cut	a	fresh	butternut	
into small chunks, and place in a microwave-safe dish covered with 1 inch of water.  Microwave on high 
for 5–10 minutes, or until squash is tender and can be easily pierced with a fork.  Remove skin.  Place

cooking
sauté, pan fry, or stir fry
To cook food quickly (for just a few 
minutes), in a small amount of fat (oil, 
butter, etc.), in a sauté pan or wok over 
direct heat.  Foods that are commonly 
sautéed include meats, poultry, and 
vegetables.
boil
To heat a liquid until bubbles break the 
surface (212 °F at sea level, lower at 
altitude).  Boiling is a common way to  
cook foods such as pasta, sauces, and 
vegetables.
simmer
To cook food gently in liquid at a 
temperature that is just below the 
boiling point so that tiny bubbles just 
begin to break the surface.  Foods are 
typically brought to boil over high heat, 
and then the heat is reduced to simmer 
with a lid on the pan/pot to finish the 
cooking.  Foods that are commonly 
simmered are sauces, rice and some 
other grains, and dried beans.
brown
To cook for a short period of time over 
high heat at the beginning or end of 
cooking, often to enhance flavor and 
texture, and create a nice cooked look.  
Browning is usually done on the 
stovetop, but also may be achieved in a 
broiler.  Foods that are typically browned 
include meats, casseroles, and anything 
that needs quick melting and crisping 
on top.
bake
To cook food in an oven, thereby 
surrounding it with dry heat.  To ensure 
an accurate cooking temperature, it can 
be helpful to use an oven thermometer. 
Many ovens bake either hotter or cooler 
than their gauges read.  Foods that  
are commonly baked include seafood, 
meats, casseroles, vegetables, and 
baked goods (breads, cakes, pies, etc.).
broil
To cook food directly under or above a 
very hot heat source (~500 °F).  Food 
can be broiled in an oven, directly 
under the gas or electric heat source,  
or on a barbecue grill (known as 
“char-broiling”) directly over charcoal 
or gas heat.  Foods that are typically 
broiled include meats, poultry, and 
seafood.
grill
To cook directly over a heat source  
on metal racks or rods or on a special 
grill pan.  Meats, poultry, seafood, 
vegetables, and even some fruits grill 
beautifully.

cutting
appendix  b
chop
To cut food with a knife or 
food processor into fine, 
medium, or coarse, irregular 
pieces.
cube
To cut food into uniform 
pieces, usually ½ inch on all 
sides.
dice
To cut food into smaller 
uniform pieces, usually 1/8 to 
¼ inch on all sides.
mince
To chop food into tiny,  
irregular pieces.
slice
To cut food into flat, usually 
thin slices from larger pieces.
julienne
To cut food into thin slices 
about 1/8 inch thick and about 
2 inches long.

frequently asked questions (FAQs)
Question:  What if I can’t find certain ingredients in my supermarket?  
Can I substitute other ingredients for them? 
Some recipes have ingredients that may not be available in every supermarket 
across the country or may cost more than you want to pay.  Here are some 
suggestions for alternatives:
Fish sauce:  For 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, use ½ tablespoon anchovy paste 
(see below), ½ teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon stock or broth.
Hoisin sauce:  For 1 tablespoon Hoisin sauce, substitute ½ tablespoon lite soy 
sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ¼ teaspoon ground ginger.
Mirin:  Substitute any sweet white wine or a generic white wine with a pinch 
of sugar.
Rice vinegar:  Substitute white wine vinegar.
Asian hot chili sauce:  Substitute regular chili sauce.
Green curry paste:  For 1 tablespoon green curry paste, substitute ½ tablespoon 
yellow curry powder thinned with 1–2 teaspoons water.
Ginger root:  For 1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, substitute 1 teaspoon ginger 
powder.		Fresh	ginger	root	also	can	be	stored	in	the	freezer	for	up	to	1	year	and	
grated as needed.
Anchovy paste:  Use an equal amount of mashed canned anchovy fillets.
Question:  What is the meaning of all the different product nutrient 
label claims?
One of the best ways to find heart healthy products is to check the food labels.  
Here are some terms to look for per labeled serving to find products lower in 
sodium, fat, cholesterol, and calories.  
Sodium
Sodium-free:  Less than 5 milligrams (mg) of sodium per serving

regular version 
Reduced or less sodium:  At least 25 percent less sodium per serving than the 
regular version
Unsalted or no salt added:  No salt added to the product during processing, 
but this is not necessarily a sodium-free food
If you can't find products labeled "low-sodium," compare the Nutrition Facts 
panels on available products to find the one with the lowest amount of sodium.

Question:  How do I cut meat across the grain?
If you have ever wondered what it means to cut meat “against the grain,” here is 
your answer.
Some cuts of meat have distinct fibers in them, which make the meat difficult to 
chew.  Flank steak (typically used to make London broil), skirt steak, and brisket 
are good examples.  Cutting through the 
fibers or grain in the meat makes it 
tender and easier to chew. 
The picture at right shows the lines of the 
steak running from right to left down the 
length of the steak.  If you slice this steak 
in the same direction as those lines, you’ll 
have to chew through the fibers.  Whereas 
if you cut across the lines or the grain, the 
knife will have already done that work 
before a bite reaches your mouth. 
When slicing this type of meat, it is often recommended to slice thinly at a  
45-degree angle, as shown.

Question:  How do I zest a lemon or orange?
Zest is the colorful outer rind on a lemon or orange (not the white pith  
underneath, which is bitter).  There are several ways to grate citrus peel:
•	 Use	a	regular	vegetable	peeler	to	make	thin,	larger	slices.		
•	 Use	a	citrus	zester,	which	has	a	stainless-steel	edge	with	a	series	of	 
sharp-edged holes that cut off thin strips of the peel. 
•	 Use	a	microplane,	or	flat	grater,	which	allows	you	to	shred	multiple	small	strips	
of	peel	faster	and	with	less	pressure	than	a	regular	grater	or	citrus	zester.

Question:  What herbs can be used to substitute for an herb I don’t 
have on hand?
Although each herb has its own unique flavor, many herbs can be  
substituted for one another.  Here are some fresh or dried herb  
alternatives to try:
•	 For sage:  Try savory, marjoram, or rosemary. 
•	 For basil:  Try oregano or thyme. 
•	 For thyme:  Try basil, marjoram, oregano, or savory.
